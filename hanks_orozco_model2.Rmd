```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(pROC)
library(MLmetrics)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup

```{r}
bank = read_rds("BankChurners.rds") 
```


## Feature Engineering

```{r}
# create some cool features. Make sure you add comments so I know what you are trying to accomplish!




```


## Specification

```{r}
# specify the model to be used (i.e. KNN, Naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, bagged trees) and the tuning parameters used

ctrl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 3, classProbs=TRUE, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary)
set.seed(504) 

bank_index <- createDataPartition(banko$Churn, p = 0.80, list = FALSE)
train <- banko[ bank_index, ]
test <- banko[-bank_index, ]

# example spec for rf
fit <- train(Churn ~ .,
             data = train, 
             method = "rf",
             ntree = 20, 
             tuneLength = 3,
             metric = "ROC",
             trControl = ctrl)

fit

confusionMatrix(predict(fit, test),factor(test$Churn))
```


## Best model

```{r}
# Here are a few lines to inspect your best model. Add some comments about optimal hyperparameters.
print(fit)
print(fit$bestTune)
```


## Re-fit and evaluation

```{r}
# the "method" below should match the one you chose above. 

set.seed(1504) # I will choose a different seed for evaluation

bank_index <- createDataPartition(banko$Churn, p = 0.80, list = FALSE)
train <- banko[ bank_index, ]
test <- banko[-bank_index, ]

# example spec for rf
fit_final <- train(Churn ~ .,
             data = train, 
             method = "rf",
             tuneGrid=fit$bestTune,
             metric = "ROC",
             trControl = ctrl) 
# The last line means we will fit a model using the best tune parameters your CV found above.

myRoc <- roc(test$Churn, predict(fit_final, test, type="prob")[,2])

plot(myRoc)
auc(myRoc)
```
